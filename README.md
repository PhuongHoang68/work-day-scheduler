# Work Day Scheduler
A daily scheduler app for busy office workers.



## How it works
Each block of time is one hour, and user can input their task for that hour in there. They could save that task. The hours will be color-coded, grayed out when past, red when present, and green for future.

## User Story

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner.  

SO THAT I can manage my time effectively.
